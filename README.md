# lwc-builder-ui

LWC Builder is a tool to build, preview and configure Lightning Web Component (LWC) files to be used on the Salesforce Platform.
Configure your component settings with clicks, then press "Create" button to create component files.

## How to start?

Start simple by running `yarn watch` (or `npm run watch`, if you set up the project with `npm`). This will start the project with a local development server.

The source files are located in the [`src`](./src) folder. All web components are within the [`src/modules`](./src/modules) folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components.

This tool is built with [LWC](https://lwc.dev).
